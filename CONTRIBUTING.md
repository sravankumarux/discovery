# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing to **Microsoft Discovery**!

This repository serves **two purposes**:

1. **Discovery App distribution & community hub.** This repo is the home for the Microsoft Discovery app installer and product documentation. _Source code for Microsoft Discovery itself is not in this repository._
2. **Discovery Catalog.** This repo is the canonical metadata catalog for AI research **agents** (`agents/<name>/`) and **starter kits** (`starter-kits/<name>/`). Agent code, container images, and model weights live in your own infrastructure; the metadata and documentation that describe them live here.

The rest of this guide explains where each kind of contribution goes and what the PR-time checks expect. If you're new to Microsoft Discovery and want to install and try the app, start with the [end-user docs](docs/discovery-app/) below.

## Using the Microsoft Discovery app

If you want to install and use the app, start here:

| Doc | What it covers |
| --- | --- |
| [`docs/discovery-app/install.md`](docs/discovery-app/install.md) | Prerequisites, download, install, verify, upgrade, uninstall, and a troubleshooting table. |
| [`docs/discovery-app/quickstart.md`](docs/discovery-app/quickstart.md) | 15-minute conceptual tour — Bookshelves, Tasks, Engines, Notebooks, and the `dx` CLI. |
| [`docs/discovery-app/feedback.md`](docs/discovery-app/feedback.md) | Where to file bugs, ideas, questions, and feature feedback. |

The remainder of this file is about **contributing** to the catalog (agents and starter kits) via pull request.

## Where contributions go

Code contributions to the Microsoft Discovery app itself — its plugin, MCP tool, and use-case surfaces — are not handled in this repository (the app's source code lives elsewhere). Conversations about those surfaces happen in **Discussions**. **Catalog metadata** (`agents/<name>/`, `starter-kits/<name>/`) and **documentation** are accepted via pull request. Every PR runs through an automated review that checks structure, schema conformance, documentation, and secrets; any failures are reported inline on the PR with a remediation hint.

| Type of contribution | Where it goes | Best for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Idea / feature request** | [Discussions → Ideas](https://github.com/microsoft/discovery/discussions/categories/ideas) | "It would be great if…", feedback on what could be better. |
| **Something you built** | [Discussions → Show and tell](https://github.com/microsoft/discovery/discussions/categories/show-and-tell) | Workflows, prompts, notebooks, or anything you've put together on top of Microsoft Discovery. |
| **Question** | [Discussions → Q&A](https://github.com/microsoft/discovery/discussions/categories/q-a) | "How do I…?", "Why does…?" |
| **Bug** | [Discussions → Bugs](https://github.com/microsoft/discovery/discussions/categories/bugs) | The Bug template prompts you for version, repro steps, logs, etc. |
| **Documentation fix** | Pull request against `docs/`, `README.md`, etc. | Typos, broken links, clarifications, missing prerequisites. |
| **New agent** | Pull request adding `agents/<agent-name>/` | A prompt agent + optional Discovery-managed tools. See the [Agent authoring guide](docs/authoring-guides/agent-authoring-guide.md). |
| **New starter kit** | Pull request adding `starter-kits/<starter-kit-name>/` | A `kit.json` manifest that bundles one or more agents into a launchable kit. See the [Starter-kit authoring guide](docs/authoring-guides/starter-kit-authoring-guide.md). |
| **Discovery services utility** | Pull request against `utilities/<utility-name>/` | Operator-facing PowerShell scripts that set up or maintain Discovery services (resource-provider registration, RBAC, data-asset migration). See [`utilities/README.md`](utilities/README.md). |
| **Schema / workflow change** | Pull request against `docs/schemas/` or `.github/workflows/` — **Microsoft maintainers only** (enforced by CODEOWNERS + branch protection). External contributors should open an **Idea in Discussions** first; a Microsoft maintainer will land the change once it is agreed. | All PRs (including maintainers') come from forks. CODEOWNERS makes schema and workflow edits land only when a maintainer approves. |
| **Discussion triage / answers** | [Discussions](https://github.com/microsoft/discovery/discussions) | Helping other community members. |

## Authoring a catalog PR

> Applies to agent submissions, starter-kit submissions, and documentation changes. Every PR runs through an automated review that enforces structural, schema, policy, documentation, and security checks. Address any failures reported on your PR; the comment includes a rule ID and a remediation hint. Detailed walkthroughs:
>
> - [Agent authoring guide](docs/authoring-guides/agent-authoring-guide.md)
> - [Starter-kit authoring guide](docs/authoring-guides/starter-kit-authoring-guide.md)

### Quick start

1. **Fork** this repo and create a topic branch on your fork. All PRs — including those by Microsoft maintainers — come from forks.
2. Add your agent under `agents/<agent-name>/` or your starter kit under `starter-kits/<starter-kit-name>/`. See [Repository layout](#repository-layout) below for the expected file tree.
3. Open a pull request against `main` and fill out **every** section of the PR template.
4. Automated checks will run on your PR. If anything fails, the bot adds an inline comment with the rule ID and how to fix it — address every finding before requesting human review.
5. When the pr-review validator passes, the `pr-validation-passed` label is applied and the [CODEOWNERS](.github/CODEOWNERS) maintainers are auto-requested for review. Other status checks (unit tests, schema regression, etc.) report independently — see the PR status rollup for the full picture. **One CODEOWNERS approval** is required to merge.

The PR review also spellchecks changed agent and starter-kit prose. `SPELL-001`
annotations are advisory warnings: they never block merge, and code, identifiers,
URLs, and fenced Markdown examples are excluded from the check.

After merge, the weekly security scan submits declared catalog webpage URLs as
exact strings to the [URLhaus](https://urlhaus.abuse.ch/) malware-reputation API
and the [PhishTank](https://www.phishtank.com/) phishing-reputation API. The
audit queries those databases only; it does not visit listed catalog webpages
or download remote content.

### Required files

#### For an agent (`agents/<agent-name>/`)

| File | Purpose | Schema |
|------|---------|--------|
| `metadata.yaml` | Identity, publisher info, tags, optional `publisher.party` (`1p` / `3p`) | [`docs/schemas/metadata-schema.json`](docs/schemas/metadata-schema.json) |
| `agent.yaml` | Prompt-agent definition (`kind: prompt` only) | [`docs/schemas/agent-schema-v2.json`](docs/schemas/agent-schema-v2.json) |
| `README.md` | Usage guide — must contain `## Overview`, `## Usage`, `## Prerequisites`, `## Architecture`, `## Configuration`, `## Known Limitations`, and `## Contributing` sections | n/a |
| `tools/<tool-name>/tool.yaml` (optional) | Discovery-managed tool definition | [`docs/schemas/tool-definition-schema.json`](docs/schemas/tool-definition-schema.json) |
| `tools/<tool-name>/Dockerfile` (optional) | Container build for the tool | n/a |

#### For a starter kit (`starter-kits/<starter-kit-name>/`)

The kit folder must contain **only** `kit.json`. Logos, screenshots, and any other assets must be referenced via HTTPS URLs — they cannot live inside the kit folder.

| File | Purpose | Schema |
|------|---------|--------|
| `kit.json` | Kit manifest — `agentRefs`, `defaultPrompts`, `samplePrompts`, optional `party` (`1p` / `3p`) | [`docs/schemas/starter-kit-schema.json`](docs/schemas/starter-kit-schema.json) |

### Authoring checklist

Before opening a PR, verify:

- [ ] Folder name matches `metadata.yaml.name` (or `kit.json.name`).
- [ ] `version` follows SemVer (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`).
- [ ] `tags` are lowercase, hyphen-separated, and non-empty.
- [ ] Contact email domains resolve in DNS and webpage URLs return public HTML pages over HTTPS.
- [ ] `README.md` includes all required sections.
- [ ] No placeholder markers (`TODO`, `FIXME`, `XXX`) in metadata, agent definition, or README.
- [ ] No duplicate mapping keys in any YAML file.
- [ ] No hidden / OS artefacts (`.DS_Store`, `.env`, `*.swp`, `.idea/`, `.vs/`, etc.).
- [ ] No hand-edits to `.auto-registry/**` — the registries are rebuilt automatically after merge.
- [ ] If your agent depends on Discovery-managed tools, `agent.yaml.discoveryExtensions.tools[]` declares them.
- [ ] If model-weight files are added, they are Git-LFS tracked, ≤5 GB each, and in an allowed format.

### Schema changes

> **Microsoft maintainers only.** Edits under `docs/schemas/` define the contract every agent and kit in the repo must satisfy. **This is enforced by `.github/CODEOWNERS` plus branch protection's "Require review from Code Owners"** — a schema PR cannot land without a Microsoft maintainer's approval, regardless of who opened it. If you are an external contributor and need a schema change, please [open an Idea in Discussions](https://github.com/microsoft/discovery/discussions/categories/ideas) describing the use case so a Microsoft maintainer can land the change.

### Test model

Repository-owned validator tests live under `.github/tests/` and run together in
the `Unit Tests` workflow with `python -m pytest .github/tests/ -v`. This suite
covers agents and starter kits through trusted schema, policy, registry, and
validator code.

Agent tool authors may place focused `test_*.py` or `*_test.py` files beside a
tool. The registry records their presence as `auto:has-tests`, but privileged PR
workflows do not execute submitted test code. Tool tests may invoke subprocesses,
download models, require GPUs, or otherwise cross the untrusted-code boundary;
authors must run them in their own isolated environment or CI before submission.

Starter-kit folders cannot contain test files because they may contain only
`kit.json`. Starter-kit behavior is covered by the trusted schema-security and
starter-kit validator suites instead.

## Repository layout

For the full repository layout — `agents/`, `starter-kits/`, `.auto-registry/`, `docs/`, `.github/`, and where each schema and script lives — see the **"Repository layout" section of [`README.md`](README.md)**.

Two things to remember as a contributor:

- Both `agents/` and `starter-kits/` use a **flat layout**: one folder per agent or kit directly under the parent directory — no `microsoft/` or `partners/` levels.
- A starter-kit folder may contain **only** `kit.json`. Logos, screenshots, READMEs, and other assets must be hosted externally and referenced by HTTPS URL (enforced by `SKT-STR-008` / `SKT-AST-001`).
