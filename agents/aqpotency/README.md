# SandboxAQ AQPotency Agent

Predicts small-molecule binding potency with uncertainty against protein targets using SandboxAQ **AQPotency**, scans molecules against a safety and selectivity protein panel, checks selectivity across explicitly named targets, and screens whole compound libraries. Intended for hit triage and lead prioritization ahead of experimental work.

## Overview

Medicinal chemistry programs decide which compounds to make next, repeatedly, under uncertainty. AQPotency supports that decision with a proteochemometric model that predicts potency for a molecule-target pair and reports how much confidence the prediction deserves.

This agent gives Discovery users conversational access to four framings of that question: one compound against one target, one compound against a fixed safety panel, one compound across a named target set, and a library against a target. It submits the job to the SandboxAQ AI Simulation Platform, tracks it, and returns per-compound results with uncertainty attached.

**Intended user:** medicinal chemists, computational chemists, and computational biologists prioritizing compounds and assessing off-target liabilities.

**Successful outcome:** predicted potencies with uncertainty, correctly attributed to molecule and target, with weakly-supported predictions clearly marked so they are not ranked as though they were confident.

The agent holds no compute of its own and ships no container. It is a prompt agent with a single Foundry-native MCP tool, scoped by `allowed_tools` to the AQPotency, upload, and job-management tools. All prediction happens on SandboxAQ infrastructure.

**Data flow.** Molecules enter as SMILES and targets as protein accessions. Library screens require the library to be uploaded to the platform first, so the agent completes the upload chain — obtain destination, upload, confirm, verify session — before submitting a screen, and stops if any step fails rather than screening a library that may be absent or truncated.

**Asynchronous by design.** Predictions are jobs. The agent reports the job identifier before polling so work survives a session ending mid-run, and hands the identifier back rather than holding a turn open indefinitely.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure AI Foundry project with a chat model deployment, supplied as `{{CHAT-MODEL}}`.
- Access to a SandboxAQ AI Simulation Platform tenant with AQPotency enabled. Contact <support@sandboxaq.com> if your organization does not have one.
- The MCP server URL for your tenant, and a credential that server accepts as a **request header**, stored as a connection in your Azure AI Foundry project. The agent references that connection by name; the credential never enters the agent definition.
- For library screening: compound libraries as SMILES, and awareness of your organization's data-handling policy for proprietary chemical matter leaving your environment.

> **Authentication note.** Foundry's MCP tool authenticates with a stored connection or static headers; it cannot complete an interactive browser OAuth flow. If your tenant is configured for interactive consent only, request a service token or equivalent header credential from your platform administrator before deploying.

## Configuration

| Parameter | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `{{CHAT-MODEL}}` | Azure AI Foundry chat model deployment name | `gpt-4o-deployment` |
| `{{AQ_MCP_SERVER_URL}}` | Base URL of your tenant's SandboxAQ AI Simulation Platform MCP server | `https://mcp.demo.aisim.sandboxaq.com` |
| `{{AQ_MCP_CONNECTION}}` | Name of the connection in your Foundry project holding the MCP server credential | `sandboxaq-aisim` |

Create the connection in your own Azure AI Foundry project before deploying. The agent definition references it by name and never carries the credential itself, so no secret appears in this catalog entry or in your deployed agent's configuration.

## Usage

1. Deploy the agent from Discovery Studio.
2. Supply the three configuration parameters above.
3. Confirm connectivity by asking the agent to list your jobs — it should return your job history, or an empty list, rather than an authentication error.
4. Ask a question in natural language.

**Single prediction**

```
Predict the potency of CC(=O)Oc1ccccc1C(=O)O against P00533.
```

**Off-target liabilities**

```
Scan this compound against the safety panel: <SMILES>
```

**Selectivity across named targets**

```
Is <SMILES> selective for P00533 over P04626 and P00519?
```

**Library screen**

```
Screen the library in library.smi against P00533 and give me the top 25 hits.
```

## Tools

Provided by the SandboxAQ AI Simulation Platform MCP server; no container images or `tools/` directory are contributed here.

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `AqpotencyPotency` | Predicted potency (pIC50) with uncertainty for one molecule against one target |
| `AqpotencyScan` | Scans one molecule against the predefined safety / selectivity protein panel |
| `AqpotencySelectivity` | Checks selectivity of one molecule across explicitly named targets |
| `AqpotencyScreen` | Screens a compound library against a target |
| `upload_files`, `upload_local_files`, `get_upload_url`, `confirm_file_upload`, `check_upload_session` | Compound-library upload chain |
| `list_jobs`, `check_job_status`, `get_job_results` | Job management |

`AqpotencyScan` uses a fixed panel whose members are not user-selectable; `AqpotencySelectivity` is the tool for a caller-specified target set. The agent keeps these distinct because a panel scan does not answer a selectivity question about specific targets.

## Known Limitations

- **Submissions are metered, and screens cost far more than single predictions.** The agent runs with human-in-the-loop enabled and states its plan — tool, molecules, resolved accessions, and library size — for approval before submitting.
- **Predictions are model output, not measurements.** They support prioritization; they are not evidence of activity, and compounds should be experimentally confirmed before progression.
- **Uncertainty is part of the result, not a footnote.** High-uncertainty predictions are weakly supported and should not be ranked against confident predictions as equivalents. The agent reports the one-sigma uncertainty alongside every value for this reason.
- **Ligand similarity bounds what a prediction means.** Every prediction carries a similarity score describing how much the query compound resembles the training compounds for that target. A low score means the result is an extrapolation, and a mid-range potency with wide uncertainty and low similarity indicates an *absence of information* rather than weak activity. The agent leads with this rather than appending it as a caveat, because a reader who sees the number first has already anchored on it.
- **A clean panel scan is not a safety claim.** It is one in-silico signal, over a fixed panel, and says nothing about targets outside that panel.
- **Not for clinical use.** The agent provides no clinical, medical, or dosing advice and its output is not evidence of human safety or efficacy.
- **Accession mapping is a failure mode.** Prose target names must be resolved to accessions; the agent confirms its intended accession rather than assuming, but a wrong accession produces a plausible number for the wrong protein.
- **Library screens can run long** and may not complete within a conversation; the agent returns a job identifier for later retrieval.
- **Uploaded libraries leave your environment.** Screening sends chemical matter to the platform. Confirm this is permitted under your organization's data-handling policy before uploading proprietary libraries.
- **Interactive-OAuth tenants are not supported** without a header credential — see the authentication note under Prerequisites.
